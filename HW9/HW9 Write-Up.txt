Currently, a lot of the features work for a basic Scrabble game
that has only one row. There are quite a few bugs relating to
issues not on the grading criteria, such as a tile being reloaded
if dragged on the board and dragged back on the tile rack. There
is also an unimplemented feature of the game where the user can
drag the tile pieces from the rack onto any place on the board.
For now, the letters do not have to be consecutive on the board
in order to form a word. I did not implement any validation nor
did I link it to a dictionary.

You can play a very basic simple Scrabble game where you can
drag letters to the tile board, click submit, and points will
be awarded to the user and new tiles will appear on the tile
rack. It's important to note that the star has no multiplier
attached to it and there are places on the Scrabble board where
the piece or pieces can earn double letter, double word, triple
letter, or triple word points. I had to take some time to
photoshop the pieces so that it blends in with the background color
of the Scrabble board.
